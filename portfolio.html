        <p>Hi My name is Nuphawan Champanuan. Yep!! my first name and last name it is so long,
            so all my friends call me "Opal"---> my nickname. I come from Thailand. I love to cook and do something new. 
            I moved to Tennessee for 4 years. I have a dream like all the people in the world.
            I like to do learn a new things and looking for new opportunity. I never think I will be here in the US in my life.
            I love over here becuase I always meet a nice people. I have a lot of my funny and crazy story but I can't tell it all.
            If you know me and close to me you will say "OMG!!! This girl so silly"
